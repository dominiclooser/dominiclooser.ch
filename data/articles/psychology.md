The core experiences of psychological trauma are disempowerment and disconnection from others. Recovery, therefore, is based upon the empowerment of the survivor and the creation of new connections. Recovery can take place only within the context of relationships; it cannot occur in isolation. In her renewed connections with other people, the survivor re-creates the psychollgical faculties that were damaged or deformed by the traumatic experience. 
-- Trauma and Recover (Judith Herman)
